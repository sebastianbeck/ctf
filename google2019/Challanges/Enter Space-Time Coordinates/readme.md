# Enter Space-Time Coordinates
Ok well done. The console is on. It's asking for coordinates. Beating heavily on the console yields little results, but the only time anything changes on your display is when you put in numbers.. So what numbers are you going to go for?  You see the starship's logs, but is there a manual? Or should you just keep beating the console?

# Challange
You can download a [zip](https://github.com/sebastianbeck/ctf/blob/master/google2019/Challanges/Enter%20Space-Time%20Coordinates/00c2a73eec8abb4afb9c3ef3a161b64b451446910535bfc0cc81c2b04aa132ed.zip). In the zip are two files, one log file and one executable. The URL to the challange contains *reversing-rand2*. This suggests that we have to do some reverse engineering. I openend the file in EDB and found the flag by scrolling through it.
