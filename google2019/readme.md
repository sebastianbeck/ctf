# Beginners Quest

Welcome to Beginners Quest! A few notes before your embark:
*There are multiple paths that lead through different challenges, to 4 different endings.
*Only after solving the most difficult challenges do you receive the "winning" ending.
*Save your flags in case you want to try different branches later, after reaching an ending.
*Three challenges have two flags, each taking you towards a different path.
*See the map for an overview of the challenges and paths.
*Problems vary in both difficulty and time to solve (ie. some might be easier but take more time to do the work for the flag.) You can go back to make different choices if you don't like what is ahead.
## Invitation
You are a simple life form, exiled from your home planet and in search of a new place to call home. The ruling came fast. Your taste in music was deemed to be far too "out-there-man" for anyone to possibly associate with you anymore. You were given 60 revolutions of Xenon around Fir to leave and never return. Gather whatever possessions and leave. You find your parents music collection, oddly in it is a golden disc labelled "Property of NASA, if lost please return to: EVNJAKL 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway Mountain View California." The music on the disc was uncovered a while back and was not very interesting. This weird language that said something about "Peace, love and rock and roll. Also we're having a really cool party tonight, so for whoever is out there, bring a friend and come along! Co-ordinates enclosed." On the back the words "Draft, do not distribute or load onto probe" written in big red letters. That could mean anything.

You'll go, since you have nowhere else to go. But you'll be careful. You well know to learn all you can about alien beings before making contact. They could be hostile, or listen to boring music. Time is slipping away fast, you race aboard the nearest ObarPool Spaceship. But you've never driven one... what next genius?

## Arrival & Reconnaissance
Having successfully figured out this "coordinate" problem. The ship lurches forward violently into space. This is one of the moments when you realize that some kind of thought or plan would have been good, but typically for you and how you found yourself in this situation, you didn't think too much before acting. Only the stars themselves know where you'll end up.

After what seems like an eternity, or at least one full season of "Xenon's Next Top Galactic Overlord" you arrive in a system of 9 planetary bodies, though one of them is exceptionally small. You nostalgically remember playing explodatoid with your friends and hunting down planets like this. But this small planet registers a hive of noise and activity on your ships automated scanners. There's things there! Billions upon trillions of things, moving around, flying, swimming, sliding, falling.

Of particular interest may be the insect-like creatures flying around this planet, uniformly. One has the words "Osmium Satellites" written on it. Maybe this is a starting point to get to know what's ahead of you

## Your Choice!
Having found the information you were looking for, while detailed, it presents you with an interesting dilemma. There is a network of "computers" not completely dissimilar to your computrator-machine on your ship. You find yourself in possession of the credentials of an individual on the planet named "SarahH." Great, with these you can get right into the secret world of an earthling without them knowing you're there. You access "SarahH home network," to find two computers: "work" and "home." Not knowing what either of these are, you have to make a decision.

## Government Agriculture Network (Path Home Network)
Well it seems someone can't keep their work life and their home life separate. You vaguely recall on your home planet, posters put up everywhere that said "Loose Zips sink large commercial properties with a responsibility to the shareholders." You wonder if there is a similar concept here.

Using the credentials to access this so-called Agricultural network, you realize that SarahH was just hired as a vendor or contract worker and given access that was equivalent. You can only assume that Vendor/Contractor is the highest possible rank bestowed upon only the most revered and well regarded individuals of the land and expect information and access to flow like the Xenovian acid streams you used to bathe in as a child.

The portal picture displays that small very attractive individual whom you instantly form a bond with, despite not knowing. You must meet this entity! Converse and convince them you're meant to be! After a brief amount of time the picture shifts into a biped presumably ingesting this creature! HOW DARE THEY. You have to save them, you have to stop this from happening. Get more information about this Gubberment thing and stop this atrocity.

You need to get in closer to save them - you beat on the window, but you need access to the cauliflower's host to rescue it.

## Work Computer sandbox Day 2 easy
With the confidence of conviction and decision making skills that made you a contender for Xenon's Universal takeover council, now disbanded, you forge ahead to the work computer.   This machine announces itself to you, surprisingly with a detailed description of all its hardware and peripherals. Your first thought is "Why does the display stand need to announce its price? And exactly how much does 999 dollars convert to in Xenonivian Bucklets?" You always were one for the trivialities of things.

Also presented is an image of a fascinating round and bumpy creature, labeled "Cauliflower for cWo" - are "Cauliflowers" earthlings?  Your 40 hearts skip a beat - these are not the strange unrelatable bipeds you imagined earthings to be.. this looks like your neighbors back home. Such curdley lobes. Will it be at the party?

SarahH, who appears to be  a programmer with several clients, has left open a terminal.  Oops.  Sorry clients!  Aliens will be poking around attempting to access your networks.. looking for Cauliflower.   That is, *if* they can learn to navigate such things.
